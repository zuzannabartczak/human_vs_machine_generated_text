The method\r\nworks by fixing an identifier for groups of phrases, words and the concept that\r\nall denote this concept, replace the occurrences of the phrases and words by\r\nthis identifier in the training corpus, creating a \"tagged\" corpus, and then\r\nappending the tagged corpus to the original corpus for training.  The\r\nconcept\/phrase\/word sets are taken from an ontology.  Since the domain of\r\napplication is biomedical, the related corpora and ontologies are used.  The\r\nresearchers also report that they achieve competitive performance on concept similarity and relatedness tasks, indicating the effectiveness of their approach. Moreover, the method showcases its advantage by requiring no human annotation of the corpus, which reduces the time and cost associated with manual efforts. The authors also highlight the superior vocabulary coverage of their embeddings, with more than 3x coverage in terms of vocabulary size compared to existing methods. This aspect is crucial in ensuring a comprehensive representation of concepts, phrases, and words in the embedding space. By jointly embedding these different linguistic units, the proposed method paves the way for a more holistic understanding and analysis of text data in the biomedical domain. Overall, the paper contributes to the field of embedding ontology concepts by presenting a novel weakly-supervised method that captures the relationships between concepts, phrases, and words in an unsupervised manner. The results achieved in terms of performance, coverage, and cost-effectiveness make this approach a valuable addition to the existing literature. However, further experiments and evaluations across different domains and corpora could enhance the generalizability of the proposed method and provide a more comprehensive assessment of its capabilities. Nonetheless, the work presented in this paper is a promising step towards jointly embedding concepts, phrases, and words, and it opens up avenues for future research in the field.","label":94}

Using this, the paper uses what is essentially the skip-gram\r\nmethod to train embeddings for words, the now atomic phrases and also the\r\nconcepts associated with them. The proposed work is evaluated on the task of\r\nconcept similarity and relatedness using UMLS and Yago to act as the backing\r\nontologies.\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\n\r\nThe The proposed work is evaluated on the task of concept similarity and relatedness using UMLS and Yago to act as the backing ontologies.\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\n\r\nThe paper addresses an important problem of embedding concepts, phrases, and words into vector spaces, which has important applications in various natural language processing tasks. The use of representative phrases for ontology concepts as distant supervision is a novel approach that allows for the learning of embeddings without expensive manual annotation or reliance on automated concept tagging methods. The paper also provides a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method on concept similarity and relatedness tasks, comparing the performance of the embeddings with existing methods and demonstrating competitive results. The achieved performance is particularly impressive considering the absence of human corpus annotation and the significant coverage in the vocabulary size.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nOne potential weakness of the proposed method is the reliance on the representative phrases for ontology concepts. While using these phrases as distant supervision allows for the learning of embeddings, it may also introduce noise or biases into the embedding space. It would be beneficial for the authors to further investigate the impact of using different representative phrases and examine whether the embeddings are sensitive to the choice of phrases. Additionally, the paper lacks a detailed discussion of the limitations and potential future directions of the proposed method.\r\n\r\nOverall, this paper presents a novel weakly-supervised method for jointly embedding concepts, phrases, and words using representative phrases as distant supervision.

{"id":"2dbf1cd7-ae9d-4f43-8e07-d981e1b97c14","text":"The authors presents a method to jointly embed words, phrases and concepts,\r\nbased on plain text corpora and a manually-constructed ontology, in which\r\nconcepts are represented by one or more phrases. They apply their method in the\r\nmedical domain using the UMLS ontology, and in the general domain using the\r\nYAGO ontology. To evaluate their approach, the authors compare it to simpler\r\nbaselines and prior work, mostly on intrinsic similarity and relatedness\r\nbenchmarks. They use existing benchmarks in the medical domain, and use\r\nmechanical turkers to generate a new general-domain concept similarity and\r\nrelatedness dataset, which they also intend to release. They report results\r\nthat are comparable to prior work.\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\n\r\n- The proposed joint embedding model is straightforward and makes reasonable\r\nsense to me. Its main value in my mind is in reaching a (configurable) middle\r\nground between treating phrases as atomic units on one hand to considering\r\ntheir\r\ncompositionallity on the other. The same approach is applied to concepts being\r\n\u2018composed\u2019 of several representative phrases.\r\n\r\n-  The paper describes a decent volume of work, including model development,\r\nan additional contribution in the form of a new evaluation dataset, and several\r\nevaluations and analyses performed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\n- The evaluation reported in this paper includes only intrinsic tasks, mainly\r\non similarity\/relatedness datasets. As the authors note, such evaluations are\r\nknown to have very limited power in predicting the utility of embeddings in\r\nextrinsic tasks. Accordingly, it has become recently much more common to\r\ninclude at least one or two extrinsic tasks as part of the evaluation of\r\nembedding models.\r\n\r\n- The similarity\/relatedness evaluation datasets used in the paper are\r\npresented as datasets recording human judgements of similarity between\r\nconcepts. However, if I understand correctly, the actual judgements were made\r\nbased on presenting phrases to the human annotators, and therefore they should\r\nbe considered as phrase similarity datasets, and analyzed as such.\r\n\r\n- The medical concept evaluation dataset, \u2018mini MayoSRS\u2019 is extremely small\r\n(29 pairs), and its larger superset \u2018MayoSRS\u2019 is only a little larger (101\r\npairs) and was reported to have a relatively low human annotator agreement. The\r\nother medical concept evaluation dataset, \u2018UMNSRS\u2019, is more reasonable in\r\nsize, but is based only on concepts that can be represented as single words,\r\nand were represented as such to the human annotators. This should be mentioned\r\nin the paper and makes the relevance of this dataset questionable with respect\r\nto representations of phrases and general concepts. \r\n\r\n- As the authors themselves note, they (quite extensively) fine tune their\r\nhyperparameters on the very same datasets for which they report their results\r\nand compare them with prior work. This makes all the reported results and\r\nanalyses questionable.\r\n\r\n- - The authors could have provided more explanation and justification for their choice of the joint embedding model. While it is described as a 'middle ground' approach, it is still important to discuss why this particular approach was chosen and how it compares to other existing models.\r\n\r\n- The lack of extrinsic task evaluations is a major limitation of the paper. Including such evaluations would have provided a more comprehensive assessment of the proposed method's usefulness in real-world applications.\r\n\r\n- The use of phrase similarity datasets as proxies for concept similarity is a valid concern. The authors should carefully analyze and discuss the implications of using phrase-based datasets instead of concept-based datasets.\r\n\r\n- The small size and low human annotator agreement of the medical concept evaluation datasets are limiting factors. It would be beneficial to include larger and more diverse medical concept datasets to provide a more robust evaluation.\r\n\r\n- The fine-tuning of hyperparameters on the same datasets used for evaluation raises questions about result reliability. The authors should consider conducting robustness experiments by using separate datasets for hyperparameter tuning.\r\n\r\n- Overall, while the paper presents a novel approach to jointly embedding concepts, phrases, and words, it lacks in-depth evaluation and critical analysis of its limitations. I would suggest addressing these weaknesses and conducting further experiments to strengthen the paper's conclusions.","label":403}

The paper addresses an important research gap by tackling the issue of interdependencies and relations among utterances in videos. The proposed LSTM-based model introduces a novel approach of capturing contextual information from the surrounding utterances within the same video, resulting in improved classification performance compared to the state of the art. One significant strength of this paper is its emphasis on the multimodal aspect of sentiment analysis in videos. By considering not only the textual content but also other modalities such as visual and acoustic cues, the proposed model demonstrates a comprehensive approach to sentiment analysis. This not only enhances the accuracy of sentiment classification but also enables a more nuanced understanding of the sentiment expressed in user-generated videos.The reported performance improvement of 5-10% over the state of the art is impressive and signifies the effectiveness of the proposed model. Additionally, the authors' mention of high robustness to generalizability highlights the practicality and applicability of their approach across various video datasets. However, there are a few aspects that I believe could be further addressed in the paper. Firstly, although the abstract highlights the LSTM-based model, it would be beneficial to provide more technical details about the proposed architecture in the main body of the paper. This would enable readers to better understand the workings of the model and potentially replicate the experiments in their own research.Furthermore, it would be valuable to discuss the limitations of the proposed approach and potential avenues for future research. While the paper focuses on utterances within a video, it would be interesting to explore how the proposed model performs in the presence of longer videos or when capturing temporal dependencies across multiple videos. In conclusion, 'Context-Dependent Sentiment Analysis in User-Generated Videos' presents a significant contribution to the field of multimodal sentiment analysis. The proposed LSTM-based model effectively captures contextual information from utterances within a video, leading to improved sentiment classification performance. I appreciate the authors' efforts and believe that addressing the aforementioned suggestions would enhance the clarity and impact of the paper.

The\r\nintroduction presents the key claims of the paper: Previous CNN\r\napproaches are bad when no phrase-level supervision is present.\r\nPhrase-level annotation is expensive. The contribution of this paper is\r\ninstead a \"simple model\" using other linguistic resources.\r\n\r\nThe related work section provides a good review of sentiment\r\nliterature. However, there is no mention of previous attempts at\r\nlinguistic regularization (e.g., [YOG14]).\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the regularizers in section 4 is rather lengthy and\r\nrepetitive. The listing on p. 3 could very well be merged with the\r\nrespective subsection 4.1-4.4. Notation in this section is inconsistent\r\nand generally hard to follow. Most notably, p is sometimes used with a\r\nsubscript and sometimes with a superscript.  The parameter \\beta is\r\nnever explicitly mentioned in the text. It is not entirely clear to me\r\nwhat constitutes a \"position\" t in the terminology of the paper. t is a\r\nparameter to the LSTM output, so it seems to be the index of a\r\nsentence. Thus, t-1 is the preceding sentence, and p_t is the prediction\r\nfor this sentence. However, the description of the regularizers talks\r\nabout preceding words, not sentences, but still uses. My assumption here\r\nis that p_t is actually overloaded and may either mean the sentiment of\r\na sentence or a word. However, this should be made clearer in the text.\r\n\r\nOne dangerous issue in this paper is that the authors tread a fine line between regularization and distant supervision. While the use of linguistic resources is mentioned as a key contribution, it would have been helpful to see a more detailed explanation of how these resources were incorporated into the model. The experiments are described well and the results show that the proposed models are able to capture the linguistic role of sentiment and intensity words. However, the baselines used in the experiments appear to be mostly poorly informed, which raises concerns about the robustness of the proposed models. Additionally, it would have been beneficial to see a more comprehensive comparison with existing state-of-the-art models for sentiment classification. The related work section provides a good overview of sentiment literature, but it lacks discussion on previous attempts at linguistic regularization, such as [YOG14].

Furthermore, the inconsistency in notation and lack of clarity around what constitutes a \"position\" in the terminology of the paper make it difficult to follow the details of the model.

They evaluate it on three morphology datasets.\r\n\r\nThis paper is a tough one. One the one hand it is well-written, mostly very\r\nclear and also presents a novel idea, namely including monotonicity in\r\nmorphology tasks. \r\n\r\nThe reason for including such monotonicity is pretty obvious: Unlike machine\r\ntranslation, many seq2seq tasks are monotone, and therefore general\r\nencoder-decoder models should not be used in the first place. That they still\r\nperform reasonably well should be considered a strong argument for neural\r\ntechniques, in general. The idea of this paper is now to explicity enforce a\r\nmonotonic output character generation. They do this by decoupling alignment and\r\ntransduction and first aligning input-output sequences monotonically and\r\nthen training to generate outputs in agreement with the monotone alignments.\r\nHowever, the authors are unclear on this point. I have a few questions:\r\n\r\n1) How do your alignments look like? On the one hand, the alignments seem to\r\nbe of the kind 1-to-many (as in the running example, Fig.1), that is, 1 input\r\ncharacter can be aligned with zero, 1, or several output characters. However,\r\nthis seems to contrast with the description given in lines 311-312 where the\r\nauthors speak of several input characters aligned to 1 output character. That\r\nis, do you use 1-to-many, many-to-1 or many-to-many alignments?\r\n\r\n2) Actually, there is a quite simple approach to monotone Seq2Seq. In a first\r\nstage, align input and output characters monotonically with a 1-to-many\r\nconstraint (one can use any monotone aligner, such as the toolkit of\r\nJiampojamarn and Kondrak). Then one trains a standard sequence tagger(!) to\r\npredict exactly these 1-to-many alignments. For example, flog->fliege (your\r\nexample on l.613): First align as in \"f-l-o-g \/ f-l-ie-ge\". Now use any tagger\r\n(could use an LSTM, if you like) to predict \"f-l-ie-ge\" (sequence of length 4)\r\nfrom \"f-l-o-g\" (sequence of length 4)..Based on the partial review, the paper: 'Morphological Inflection Generation with Hard Monotonic Attention' presents a novel idea of incorporating monotonicity in morphological tasks using a new encoder-decoder model with 'hard monotonic attention'. The authors address the limitation of general encoder-decoder models in handling monotone sequence-to-sequence tasks and propose an approach that enforces explicit monotonic output character generation.\r\n\r\nThe paper is well-written and effectively argues for the importance of considering monotonicity in neural techniques for sequence generation. The experimental evaluation of the proposed model on three morphology datasets showcases its state-of-the-art performance compared to both neural and non-neural approaches. However, a few concerns and questions arise from the partial review:\r\n\r\n1) The clarity regarding the alignments could be improved. While the running example suggests 1-to-many alignments, the authors mention several input characters aligned to 1 output character in some instances. It would be beneficial for the authors to provide further explanation and clarification regarding the types of alignments employed (1-to-many, many-to-1, or many-to-many).\r\n\r\n2) The reviewer suggests a simpler approach for monotone Seq2Seq tasks using a two-step process involving monotonic alignment and training a standard sequence tagger. It would be valuable for the authors to address this suggestion and discuss how their proposed model differs and potentially outperforms this alternate approach.\r\n\r\nOverall, the paper presents a promising contribution to the field of morphological inflection generation by incorporating explicit monotonicity in sequence generation models. Addressing the concerns and questions raised in the review would further strengthen the paper and provide additional insights into the proposed model's advantages over alternative approaches.

To answer this question, this paper applied word representations with various subunits (characters, character-trigram, and morphs).

However, the authors note that previous research using statistical models has shown that global optimization can lead to better performance in relation extraction.

The\r\nresults offer modest but consistent support for the general idea, and they\r\nprovide some initial insights into how best to translate this idea into a\r\nmodel. The paper distribution includes the TensorFlow-based models used for the\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nSome critical comments and questions:\r\n\r\n* The introduction is unusual in that it is more like a literature review than\r\na full overview of what the paper contains. This leads to some redundancy with\r\nthe related work section that follows it. I guess I am open to a non-standard\r\nsort of intro, but this one really doesn't work: despite reviewing a lot of\r\nideas, it doesn't take a stand on what causation is or how it is expressed, but\r\nrather only makes a negative point (it's not reducible to syntax). We aren't\r\nreally told what the positive contribution will be except for the very general\r\nfinal paragraph of the section.\r\n\r\n* Extending the above, I found it disappointing that the paper isn't really\r\nclear about the theory of causation being assumed. The authors seem to default\r\nto a counterfactual view that is broadly like that of David Lewis, where\r\ncausation is a modal sufficiency claim with some other counterfactual\r\nconditions added to it. See line 238 The authors should provide a clearer explanation of the theory of causation being assumed in their study. While they briefly mention a counterfactual view similar to that of David Lewis, it would be useful for readers who are not familiar with this theory to have a more detailed description. Additionally, it would be valuable to discuss alternative theories of causation and explain why the chosen perspective is relevant to their research.One concern I have is with the methodology used in the experiments. It would be helpful to have more information about the AltLex corpus and how it was developed. Is it a widely accepted dataset in the field of causality classification? How was the corpus annotated and what steps were taken to ensure its reliability? Without this information, it is difficult to fully evaluate the validity and generalizability of the results.Furthermore, while the results of the experiments demonstrate that the proposed neural network architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art, it would be beneficial to have a more in-depth analysis and interpretation of these findings. For example, are there certain types of sentences or lexical markers that the model struggles to classify correctly? Are there any limitations or potential biases in the dataset that could affect the results? Providing more detailed insights and discussing potential avenues for future research would enhance the paper's contribution to the field.Lastly, the paper's writing style could be improved to increase clarity and readability. There are instances where the language is overly technical and difficult to understand without prior knowledge in the field. Simplifying complex concepts and explaining them in a more accessible manner would broaden the paper's audience and make it more engaging for readers.In conclusion, while this paper presents an interesting approach to causal lexical marker disambiguation based on context, there are several aspects that could benefit from further development and clarification. Providing a clearer explanation of the assumed theory of causation, addressing concerns about the methodology, conducting a more detailed analysis of the results, and improving the writing style would strengthen the overall contribution of the paper.","label":253}
{"id":"59d2e826-0e46-437e-ac2b-2d7ab05c6c89","text":"This paper proposes a method for detecting causal relations between clauses,\r\nusing neural networks (\"deep learning\", although, as in many studies, the\r\nnetworks are not particularly deep).  Indeed, while certain discourse\r\nconnectives are unambiguous regarding the relation they signal (e.g. 'because'\r\nis causal) the paper takes advantage of a recent dataset (called AltLex, by\r\nHidey and McKeown, 2016) to solve the task of identifying causal vs. non-causal\r\nrelations when the relation is not explicitly marked.  Arguing that\r\nconvolutional networks are not as adept as representing the relevant features\r\nof clauses as LSTMs, the authors propose a classification architecture which\r\nuses a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. They first preprocess the data by tokenizing the sentences, converting them into word vectors, and padding them to a fixed length. Then, they train the LSTM model using the AltLex dataset, which contains sentences with causal and non-causal relations. The authors compare the performance of their model with a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a support vector machine (SVM) baseline. They find that their LSTM model achieves higher accuracy and outperforms both the CNN and SVM baselines. One of the strengths of this paper is the use of the AltLex dataset, which allows the authors to tackle the challenging task of identifying causal relations in sentences without explicit markers. The dataset provides a valuable resource for training and evaluating causality classification models. The authors also make a compelling argument for the superiority of LSTMs over CNNs in capturing the semantic meaning of sentences. They suggest that LSTMs are better at modeling long-range dependencies and capturing contextual information, which is crucial for disambiguating the causal meaning of sentences. The experimental results support their claim, showing that the LSTM model consistently outperforms the CNN model. Additionally, the paper is well-organized and clearly presents the methodology, experimental setup, and results. The authors provide sufficient details about the data preprocessing steps, the architecture of the LSTM model, and the hyperparameters used in the experiments. They also conduct thorough experiments and report the results with appropriate statistical analysis. However, there are a few aspects that could be further improved in this paper. Firstly, the authors could provide more insights into the limitations and potential challenges of their approach. While the LSTM model shows promising results on the AltLex dataset, it would be helpful to discuss the generalizability of the model to different domains and languages. Furthermore, the authors could explore the interpretability of their model by analyzing the attention weights of the LSTM. Understanding which parts of the sentence contribute the most to the classification decision would provide valuable insights into the causal reasoning process. Lastly, the authors could consider comparing their LSTM model with other state-of-the-art models for causality classification. This would help establish the effectiveness of their proposed architecture against existing approaches. In conclusion, this paper presents a neural network architecture based on LSTMs for the task of detecting causal relations in sentences. The authors successfully demonstrate the superiority of the LSTM model over CNNs and SVMs on the AltLex dataset. The paper is well-written and provides valuable contributions to the field of causality classification. With some additional improvements and further investigations, this work has the potential to advance our understanding of how humans comprehend causal relations in natural language.","label":94}

The authors demonstrate the value of adapting coreference resolution to Wikipedia by presenting a classifier that outperforms fair baselines built on top of state-of-the-art coreference resolution systems. This classifier takes advantage of the Wikipedia markup and external knowledge bases like Freebase to acquire useful information on entities, which helps in classifying mentions as coreferent or not. The evaluation of the classifier shows significant improvements over the baselines, indicating its effectiveness in the context of Wikipedia articles.\r\n\r\nOne notable aspect of this paper is the integration of the classifier into the Stanford coreference system. By incorporating their classifier into an existing rule-based system, the authors demonstrate the benefits of their approach in a full coreference resolution pipeline applied to Wikipedia texts. The results show substantial improvements over all state-of-the-art systems on Wikipedia, highlighting the potential of this approach in addressing coreference resolution challenges in the context of Wikipedia articles.\r\n\r\nOverall, I find this paper to be an interesting and valuable contribution to the field of coreference resolution. The authors address a unique and important task of main concept resolution in Wikipedia articles, which has not been extensively studied before. The combination of leveraging Wikipedia markup and external knowledge bases to improve coreference resolution performance is a novel and promising approach. The experimental results presented in the paper provide strong evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed classifier.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are a few areas that could be further improved. Firstly, the authors only evaluate their classifier on a limited set of 30 annotated documents. It would be beneficial to assess its performance on a larger and more diverse dataset to establish its generalizability. Secondly, the paper lacks a detailed analysis of the errors made by the classifier, which could provide insights into the limitations and potential areas for improvement. Additionally, it would be interesting to explore the impact of different external knowledge bases and their accuracies on coreference resolution performance.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field and opens up new possibilities for improving coreference resolution in the specific context of Wikipedia. The proposed classifier shows promising results and the integration into an existing coreference resolution system demonstrates its practical applicability.

It is still worse that\r\nvariational dropout on Penn Tree bank language modeling task, but given the\r\nsimplicity of the idea it is likely to become widely useful.\r\n\r\nStrengths\r\n- Simple idea that works well.\r\n- Detailed experiments help understand the effects of the zoneout probabilities\r\n  and validate its applicability to various tasks. The zoneout regularization method is shown to significantly improve performance in character- and word-level language modeling on the Penn Treebank and Text8 datasets. Additionally, when combined with recurrent batch normalization, it achieves state-of-the-art results on the permuted sequential MNIST task. The paper presents a thorough investigation of different RNN regularizers, highlighting the benefits of zoneout. It demonstrates that by preserving hidden unit activations, gradient and state information can be more effectively propagated through time. Though zoneout is not as effective as variational dropout in the Penn Treebank language modeling task, its simplicity and effectiveness make it a promising regularization technique for RNNs. Overall, the paper contributes a valuable technique for improving the performance and generalization of RNN models.","label":114}

They emphasize that their main contribution lies in analyzing why crippling is necessary, rather than simply pointing out its necessity. The text has been revised to highlight this distinction, providing a clearer understanding of the research. Furthermore, Reviewer 2 raised a valid point regarding the absence of experiments showing the impact of not using an autoregressive flow (AF) prior in VLAE. To address this concern, the authors have added related experiments in the Appendix section. This addition will provide further insights into the role of the AF prior and its impact on the latent code in the absence of such a prior.The latest revision of the manuscript primarily focuses on addressing the reviewers' main concern regarding larger scale experiments. In Section 4.3, the authors present the results of their experiments, demonstrating that VLAE achieves the current best density estimation performance on CIFAR10 among latent-code models.

The \"crippling\" method used feels hand-crafted and very task-dependent, and the qualitative evaluation of the \"lossyness\" of the learned representation is carried out on three datasets (MNIST, OMNIGLOT and Caltech-101 Silhouettes) which feature black-and-white images with little-to-no texture. Figures 1a and 2a do show that reconstructions discard low-level information, as observed in the slight variations in strokes between the input and the reconstruction, but such an analysis would have been more compelling with more complex image datasets..While the information-theoretical explanation provided in this paper is valuable, the empirical evaluation of the proposed method could be further strengthened. The chosen method for 'crippling' the autoregressive conditional distribution appears to be somewhat ad hoc and specific to the task at hand, which raises questions about its generalizability to other domains. Additionally, the qualitative evaluation of the learned representation's 'lossyness' relies on datasets that consist of black-and-white images with limited texture variations. While the reconstructions shown in Figures 1a and 2a suggest that the model can discard low-level information, it would have been more convincing to evaluate the method using more complex image datasets that contain a wider range of textures. This would provide stronger evidence of the model's ability to selectively autoencode data in a lossy fashion. By conducting experiments on diverse image datasets, the authors can better demonstrate the generalizability of their approach and its effectiveness in capturing global structure while discarding irrelevant details. Additionally, incorporating quantitative evaluation metrics, such as reconstruction error and information preservation measures, would contribute to a more comprehensive evaluation. Despite these limitations in the empirical evaluation, the paper's introduction of the 'variational lossy autoencoder' concept and the insights provided into the behavior of VAE-type models with powerful conditional distributions are significant contributions to the field of representation learning. The information-theoretical perspective sheds light on the challenges faced by VAEs in effectively utilizing their latent codes and prompts further research into designing more effective architectures for these models.

The authors propose a Variational Lossy Autoencoder (VLAE) model that combines Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with neural autoregressive models such as RNN, MADE, and PixelRNN\/CNN. By leveraging autoregressive models as both the prior distribution and the decoding distribution, the generative modeling performance of VAEs is significantly improved.

This lossy fashion of autoencoding enables efficient representation learning for downstream tasks such as classification.

My primary question is Q1, and others are predominantly comments.\r\n\r\nQ1: After learning is complete, did you try forward propagating through the network to find actions for every time-step as opposed to repeating actions? Concretely, if at t=5, action suggested by the network is a_3 with a repetition of 4, instead of sticking with a_3 for times t={5,6,7,8} perform action a_3 for just t=5 and continue with action a_4 at t=9. This would provide a better understanding of the effectiveness of temporal abstractions in the action space, as well as the planning capability enabled by sequences of repetitive macro-actions. Additionally, it would be interesting to see how the FiGAR framework performs when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches that incorporate temporal abstraction. For example, comparing FiGAR with options-based frameworks such as H-DQN or MAX-Q could shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Moreover, it would be beneficial to provide further analysis and discussion on the computational and memory requirements of the FiGAR framework. Since the agent is now able to make decisions on the time scale of action repetition, does this significantly increase the computational complexity? How does it affect the memory usage, especially when repeating actions for longer time steps? Finally, it would be valuable to discuss the limitations and potential future extensions of the FiGAR framework. Are there any specific tasks or domains where FiGAR may not be as effective? Can FiGAR be combined or extended with other techniques to further enhance its performance? Overall, this paper presents a novel framework for fine-grained action repetition, and the empirical results on multiple domains are promising. However, addressing the aforementioned questions and providing further analysis and discussion would strengthen the paper and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the FiGAR framework.","label":75}

We have uploaded a revised version of the paper that we believe addresses the questions raised. Major features of the revision are:\r\n\r\n1. We have added results on 2 more Atari 2600 games: Enduro and Q-bert. FiGAR seems to improve performance rather dramatically on Enduro with the FiGAR agent being close to 100 times better than the baseline A3C agent. (Note that the baseline agent performs very poorly according to the published results as well)\r\n\r\n2. In response to AnonReviewer3\u2019s comment about skipping intermediate frames, we have added Appendix F (page 23) by conducting experiments on what happens when FiGAR does not discard any intermediate frames (during evaluation phase). The general pattern seems to be that for games wherein lower action repetition is preferred, gains are made in terms of improved gameplay performance. However, for 24 out of 33 games the performance becomes worse, which depicts the importance of the temporal abstractions learnt by the action repetition part of the policy (\\pi_{\\theta_{x}}). This does not address the reviewer\u2019s question completely since at train time we still skip all the frames, as suggested by the action repetition part of the policy (\u03c0\u03b8\u2093). This does not address the reviewer's question completely since at train time we still skip all the frames, as suggested by the action repetition part of the policy (\u03c0\u03b8\u2093). However, we believe that our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our FiGAR framework in improving performance across various domains and reinforcement learning algorithms. The performance improvements observed in the Atari 2600 domain, Mujoco domain, and TORCS car racing domain highlight the potential of FiGAR to enhance policy search algorithms. Furthermore, the significant performance improvement in the Enduro game compared to the baseline A3C agent provides strong evidence supporting the efficacy of our approach. We would like to thank AnonReviewer3 for their suggestion of conducting experiments without skipping intermediate frames during evaluation. This additional analysis not only provides insights into the importance of temporal abstractions learned by the action repetition part of the policy but also strengthens the robustness of our framework.

Two models are described:  One where an invariance term is applied between different instantiations of the model\/input a single training step, and a second where invariance is applied to features for the same input point across training steps via a cumulative exponential averaging of the features.  These models evaluated using CIFAR-10 and SVHN, finding decent gains of similar amounts in.classification accuracy. The proposed self-ensembling method is a simple and efficient approach for training deep neural networks in a semi-supervised setting. By forming a consensus prediction of the unknown labels using the outputs of the network-in-training under different conditions, the ensemble prediction acts as an improved target for training compared to the output of the most recent epoch. This approach has shown remarkable results in reducing the classification error rate in both SVHN and CIFAR-10 benchmarks. For SVHN with 500 labels, the error rate was reduced from 18.44% to 7.05%, while for CIFAR-10 with 4000 labels, the error rate dropped from 18.63% to 16.55%. These results further improved to 5.12% and 12.16% when standard augmentations were enabled. Additionally, incorporating random images from the Tiny Images dataset as unlabeled extra inputs during training improved CIFAR-100 classification accuracy significantly. Moreover, the proposed method showed good tolerance to incorrect labels, demonstrating its robustness in handling noisy training data. In conclusion, this paper presents a novel approach to semi-supervised learning that achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. The simplicity and efficiency of the self-ensembling method make it a valuable addition to the field, with potential applications in various domains that require training deep neural networks with limited labeled data.","label":83}

The key contribution of this work is the optimization of tree structures to enhance performance on downstream tasks, contrary to prior research where the trees are predetermined or generated through supervised treebank annotations. The experiments conducted in this study clearly illustrate the advantages of learning task-specific composition orders, which outperform both sequential encoders and recursive encoders based on treebank annotations. This finding demonstrates that the optimized tree structures improve the overall performance of the model in sentence composition. Moreover, the researchers conduct an analysis of the induced trees and reveal that although these structures do uncover some linguistically intuitive components such as noun phrases and simple verb phrases, they deviate from conventional English syntactic structures. This finding suggests that the optimized trees favor alternative linguistic representations that may provide new insights into the organization and composition of sentences. Overall, this paper introduces a valuable contribution to the field of natural language processing, highlighting the significance of reinforcement learning in the generation of optimized tree structures for sentence understanding.","label":0}

There are potentially different ways a part can be part of an object (the different \\pi labels), which I would maybe call \"membership types\". In the experiments, the objects at the hierarchical level are formed by randomly selecting parts from the objects in the previous level. This method of constructing objects allows for flexibility in representing different structures and patterns within the graph. \r\n\r\nThe authors introduce three operations, 'shift', 'aggregate', and 'extract', to learn vector representations for each object. The 'shift' operation measures the influence of each part on the others within the object, providing a way to capture relationships and dependencies. The 'aggregate' operation combines the shifted representations of the parts to create a holistic representation for the object, enabling higher-level reasoning. Finally, the 'extract' operation extracts relevant features from the aggregated representation, enhancing the discriminative power of the model. The combination of these operations forms the SAEN architecture, which is tailored specifically for learning on social network data.\r\n\r\nOne interesting aspect of the proposed approach is the algorithm for domain compression, which exploits symmetries in hierarchical decompositions.

The authors provide evidence of the effectiveness of their proposed method by conducting experiments on different datasets including Orca recordings, Bird species, and the Speech TIMIT dataset.

Here it is again, with a few more thoughts added...\r\n\r\nThe authors present a great and - as far as I can tell - accurate and honest overview of the emerging theory about GANs from a likelihood ratio estimation\/divergence minimisation perspective. It is well written and a good read, and one I would recommend to people who would like to get involved in GANs.\r\n\r\nMy main problem with this submission is that it is hard as a reviewer to pin down what precisely the novelty is - beyond perhaps articulating these views better than other papers have done in the past. A sentence from the paper \"But it has left us unsatisfied since we have not gained the insight needed to choose between them.\u201d summarises my feeling about this paper: this is a nice 'unifying review\u2019 type paper that - for me - lacks a novel insight.\r\n\r\nIn summary, my assessment is mixed: I think this is a great paper, I enjoyed reading it. I was left a bit disappointed by the lack of novel insight, or a singular key new idea which you often expect in conference presentations, and this is why I\u2019m not highly confident about this as a conference submission (and hence my low score) I am open to be convinced either way.\r\n\r\nDetailed comments:\r\n\r\nI think the authors should probably discuss the lack of novel insight more explicitly in the paper. While the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature and approaches to learning in implicit generative models, it would greatly benefit the readers if they can highlight the unique contribution or perspective they bring to this field. This could be achieved by identifying a specific problem or limitation in the current approaches and proposing a novel solution or framework that addresses it. Without this clear novelty, the paper runs the risk of being perceived as just a compilation of existing knowledge.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would suggest that the authors expand on their evaluation of GANs and other approaches in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. While it is mentioned that GANs have several appealing properties, it would be helpful to have a more detailed comparison with other methods in the same space. This could include discussing the limitations of GANs, such as mode collapse or training instability, and how other approaches attempt to overcome these challenges.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I noticed that the paper briefly mentions the use of hypothesis testing as a principle for learning in implicit generative models. It would be valuable if the authors could provide more concrete examples or case studies where hypothesis testing has been successfully applied in this context. This would help to strengthen the argument for the relevance and effectiveness of this approach.\r\n\r\nLastly, I would like to see more discussion on the practical implications and potential applications of implicit generative models, particularly in domains beyond computer vision. While the paper mentions econometrics and approximate Bayesian computation, it would be interesting to explore how these models can be applied to other fields, such as natural language processing or healthcare.\r\n\r\nOverall, I believe the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the understanding and development of implicit generative models. However, in order to do so, the authors should focus on identifying and highlighting their unique insights or contributions, as well as providing a more in-depth analysis and evaluation of GANs and other approaches in this field.

Is there a sense of how many iterations of the L-BFGS method? Since that is going to be difficult given the nature of the optimization problem, one would appreciate more information on the time complexity of the proposed method. Additionally, it would be helpful to provide some comparative analysis with existing CCA-based approaches to better understand the advantages and limitations of the proposed method. Overall, the paper presents an interesting approach to finding dependent subspaces and maximizing cross-view similarity for information retrieval tasks. The motivation and problem formulation are well-described, and the method appears to be promising based on the experimental results. However, there are a few areas that could be improved in terms of clarity and thoroughness, such as providing more details on the time complexity and providing a comparative analysis with CCA-based approaches.

The authors propose a novel method that optimizes linear transformations for each view to maximize cross-view similarity between neighborhoods of data samples. This approach addresses some limitations of traditional Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) by directly optimizing for the data analysis task at hand. The criterion used in this method takes into account the well-defined retrieval task, capturing nonlinear and local similarities, and measuring dependency of data relationships rather than only individual data coordinates. This is a significant contribution as it allows for a more comprehensive understanding of local dependencies between multiple views. The experimental evaluation presented in the paper demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method compared to alternatives in preserving cross-view neighborhood similarities. This reaffirms the effectiveness of the approach in addressing the specific task of neighbor retrieval. Additionally, the insights gained from the experiments shed light on the local dependencies between multiple views, further validating the usefulness of the proposed method. However, there are a few areas that could be further improved in this paper. Firstly, the authors could provide more details about the specific datasets used in the experiments, including their characteristics and how they relate to real-world scenarios.

By doing so, it not only captures the long-term temporal dependencies in time series data, but also uses missing patterns to improve prediction results. The experiments conducted on both real-world clinical datasets (MIMIC-III, PhysioNet) and synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance.

To summarize, the main contribution of our work is to propose a novel joint model based on pointer network architecture which achieves state-of-the-art results on argumentation mining task with a large gap.  \r\n\r\nThere are three main concerns raised by the reviewers. The first and the main concern is the novelty of the model.  We believe that in part this concern is due to a misunderstanding that occurred because we mislabeled our proposed joint model as \u201cPN\u201d in the results table (see our discussion below).  We think this led some of the reviewers to believe that the paper merely pointer network model to a specific task. \r\n\r\nThe second concern is about the overall contribution of the paper to representation learning.  We argue that it is precisely the joint representation learned by our model in the encoding phase, as well as the fact that our model supports separate source and target representations for a given text span, that allows us to substantially outperform standard recurrent models.  \r\n\r\nThe third question raised by the reviewers concerns the meaningful comparison to other methods for recovering relations, such as stack-based models for syntactic parsing.  We believe that this comparison is not appropriate in our case.  As a discourse parsing task, argumentation mining requires the flexibility of recovering relations that are quite distinct from syntactic parsing, in that they allow both projective and non-projective structures, multi-root parse fragments, and components with no incoming or no outgoing links. \r\n\r\nWe give more specific responses to reviewer comments below.\r\n\r\n\u201cPointer network has been proposed before.\u201d \r\n\r\nAs is evident in Table 1, a direct application of a pointer network (PN) does not achieve state-of-the-art on link prediction.  Neither is it suitable for AC type prediction.  In fact, a direct application of PN performs substantially worse on link prediction than the joint model, which achieves state-of-the-art on both tasks in the persuasive essay corpus, as well as on link prediction in the microtext corpus. \r\n\r\n\u201cI am concerned, though, that the paper doesn't make a substantial novel contribution to representation learning.\u201d \r\n\r\nWe argue that the better performance of the joint PN model is purely due We argue that the better performance of the joint PN model is purely due to the joint representation learned by our model in the encoding phase. Unlike standard recurrent models, our model supports separate source and target representations for a given text span, enabling it to capture the hierarchical structure of argument components. This ability to encode and represent the argument structure is a novel contribution to representation learning in the context of argumentation mining.\r\n\r\nRegarding the comparison to stack-based models for syntactic parsing, we acknowledge that argumentation mining requires different parsing capabilities. The goal of our work is to uncover the argument structure in argumentative text, which involves recovering relations that are distinct from syntactic parsing. These relations can include non-projective structures, multi-root parse fragments, and components with no incoming or outgoing links. Stack-based models are designed for syntactic parsing and may not be suitable for this specific task.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to address the concerns raised by the reviewers and emphasize the contributions of our work. Our proposed joint model based on the pointer network architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the argumentation mining task and outperforms strong baselines by a large margin. The joint representation learned by our model in the encoding phase and the ability to capture the hierarchical structure of argument components are key factors contributing to its superior performance. We believe that these contributions make our work novel and valuable to the field of argumentation mining.\r\n\r\nWe will make the necessary revisions and additions to the paper to address the concerns and clarify any misunderstandings.

I have a few questions below.\r\n\r\nabout TEM:\r\nPage 4 you extracted 1 conv map of size LxD for each N frames, which means you have LxD * N features at the end, although each frame has been processed individually, the features from different frames are not related to each other.

Instead of using a single hash function, the proposed HFH approach uses multiple hash function to associate each \"virtual\" (to-be-synthesized) weight location to several components of an underlying parameter vector (shared across all layers)..The authors justify the use of multiple hash functions by explaining that it reduces the probability of hash collisions, which can lead to loss of information and degradation in the compression ratio.

A simple (albeit not particularly effective) heuristic for measuring feature importance is to measure the gradients of the predicted class wrt each pixel in an input image I. This assigns a score to each pixel in I (that ranks how much the output prediction would change if a given pixel were to change). In this paper, the authors build on this and propose to measure feature importance by computing gradients of the output wrt scaled version of the input image, alpha*I, where alpha is a scalar between 0 and 1, then summing across all values of alpha to obtain their feature importance score. Here the scaling is simply linear scaling of the pixel values (alpha=0 is all black image, alpha=1 is original image). The authors call these scaled images \u201ccounterfactuals\u201d which seems like quite an unnecessarily grandiose name for literally, a scaled image. \r\n\r\nThe authors show a number of examples where they apply their method to different deep networks, including the GoogleNet architecture for object recognition, a ligand-based virtual screening network, and an LSTM-based language model. They demonstrate how the interior gradients provide a better capture of feature importance compared to the traditional gradient approach. In their experiments, they visualize the computed feature importance scores and observe that they align more closely with human intuition. The authors also highlight the generality of their method, stating that interior gradients are applicable to a wide range of deep networks and exhibit the desirable property of feature importance scores summing up to the prediction score. This property ensures that the importance scores reflect the overall impact of the features on the network's decision and provides a meaningful interpretation. Another significant advantage of interior gradients is their simplicity of computation, which is comparable to standard gradient calculations. This simplicity is in stark contrast to previous methods that were complex to implement, making interior gradients more accessible and easier to adopt in practical applications. Overall, the authors present a compelling approach to quantifying feature importance in deep networks by introducing the concept of interior gradients.

Rather than disregarding the auxiliary annotations, the authors leverage them to enhance the learning of diverse and rich feature representations. By considering foreground and background as separate groups and encouraging orthogonality within each group, the GoCNN model enables the network to capture different aspects of the input image, leading to a stronger generalization ability.\r\n\r\nThe experiments conducted in the paper provide convincing evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed GoCNN models.

Instead of discovering the groups automatically, the work proposes to use supervision, which they call privileged information, to assign features to groups in a hand-coded fashion..The motivation behind this approach is to maximize the diversity of feature representation in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). By incorporating auxiliary annotations as privileged information, the proposed method aims to leverage this additional knowledge to enhance the generalization ability of the CNN model. The authors introduce a group orthogonal CNN (GoCNN) model, which ensures that the foreground and background features are learned in an orthogonal manner. This orthogonality is achieved by exploiting the privileged information during the optimization process. By emphasizing feature diversity within a single model, the GoCNN model aims to learn richer and more diverse feature representations.\r\n\r\nOne of the strengths of this approach is that it allows the model to leverage auxiliary annotations effectively. Instead of completely ignoring the privileged information, the proposed method incorporates it into the training process to guide the feature grouping. This is achieved by hand-coding the assignment of features to groups based on the privileged information. By doing so, the model can learn more distinctive features that capture both foreground and background information effectively.\r\n\r\nThe proposed GoCNN model is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, namely ImageNet and PASCAL VOC. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and high generalization ability of the proposed approach. The GoCNN model achieves superior performance compared to baseline models in terms of classification accuracy and generalization across different datasets. This indicates that the incorporation of privileged information and the emphasis on feature diversity contribute to better feature representation and improved generalization capability.\r\n\r\nAlthough the proposed method shows promising results, there are a few aspects that could be further explored. For instance, it would be interesting to investigate the automatic discovery of feature groups, rather than relying on hand-coded assignment based on privileged information.

The authors recognize that simply ignoring auxiliary annotations, which can provide valuable information, would be a wasted opportunity. To address this, they propose a novel CNN model called group orthogonal convolutional neural network (GoCNN) that leverages privileged information to maximize the inherent diversity of the model, leading to improved feature representation and stronger generalization ability.

There should be a baseline that leaves out the background suppression term, so readers know how much that term is contributing to the performance vs. the group orthogonal term.  The use of the background suppression term is also confusing to me -- it seems redundant, as the group orthogonality term should be sufficient to suppress the background features. Additionally, the evaluation could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the impact of the privileged information on the model's performance. While the paper claims the effectiveness and high generalization ability of the proposed GoCNN models, it would strengthen the findings to include a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in the literature. This would provide a better understanding of the relative performance of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the authors could consider conducting ablation studies to investigate the importance of each component of their method. This would help identify whether the foreground segmentation masks or the group-wise model diversity loss term contribute more significantly to the improvements in performance. Another aspect that could be addressed is the robustness of the proposed approach to variations in the privileged information. Are the results consistent across different foreground masks or do certain types of masks lead to better performance? Providing insights into these questions would enhance the understanding of the strengths and limitations of the proposed technique.

The dataset they use is impressive and useful and, frankly, more interesting than the typical toy datasets in machine learning.

This problem is formulated as a multilabel sequence classification (in contrast to language modeling, which is multiclass classification). They propose to use standard LSTM and GRU architectures with embedding layers to handle the sparse categorical inputs, similar to that described in related work by Choi, et al. In experiments using a cohort of ~610K patient records, they find that RNN models outperform strong baselines including an MLP and a random forest, as well as a common sense baseline. The differences in performance between the recurrent models and the MLP appear to be large enough to be significant, given the size of the test set.\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\n- Very important problem. As the authors point out, two the value propositions of EHRs -- which have been widely adopted throughout the US due to a combination of legislation and billions of dollars in incentives from the federal government -- included more accurate records and fewer medication mistakes. These two benefits have largely failed to materialize. This seems like a major opportunity for data mining and machine learning.\r\n- Paper is well-written with lucid introduction and motivation, thorough discussion of related work, clear description of experiments and metrics, and interesting qualitative analysis of results.\r\n- Empirical results are solid with a strong win for RNNs over convincing baselines. This is in contrast to some recent related papers, including Lipton & Kale et al, ICLR 2016, where the gap between the RNN and MLP was relatively small, and Choi et al, MLHC 2016, which omitted many obvious baselines.\r\n- Discussion is thorough and thoughtful. The authors are right about the thoroughness of the discussion and the importance of addressing the issue of errors and omissions in electronic medical records. The authors highlight the potential impact of their approach in reducing the manual labor involved in maintaining medication lists, which can lead to more accurate records and fewer medication mistakes. This paper not only presents a novel deep learning approach to predicting medications from diagnostic codes but also contributes to the broader field of data mining and machine learning in healthcare. There are a few aspects that could further strengthen the paper. Firstly, it would be beneficial to provide more details about the dataset used, such as the demographic characteristics of the patients and any potential biases or limitations. This would help to better understand the generalizability of the findings and potential implications for different patient populations. Secondly, it would be valuable to include a comprehensive comparison with other relevant studies in the field. The authors mention a few related works, but a more detailed comparison and discussion of the similarities and differences in approaches, datasets, and results would enhance the paper's contribution to the literature. Additionally, the authors mention hardware constraints on model size limiting the performance of their best model. It would be interesting to explore potential solutions or optimizations to overcome these limitations and improve the performance even further. The authors could also consider discussing the computational requirements of their models and any potential scalability challenges when applying them to larger datasets or real-world healthcare systems. Overall, this paper presents a strong contribution to the field of predicting medications from diagnostic codes using recurrent neural networks. The importance and relevance of this problem are well-motivated, and the empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over convincing baselines. The thoroughness of the discussion and the potential impact on improving the accuracy of medication records make this work highly valuable to both the research community and the healthcare industry.

I commend the authors on their attention to the narrative and the explanations.  While it did not present any new methodology or architecture, it instead addressed an important application of predicting the medications a patient is using, given the record of billing codes.  The dataset they use is impressive and useful and, frankly, more interesting than the typical toy datasets in machine learning.  That said, the investigation of those results was not as deep as I thought it should have been in an empirical\/applications paper.  Despite their focus on the application, I was encouraged to see that the authors acknowledged the limitations of their model due to hardware constraints on model size. It would have been interesting to see a discussion on potential optimizations or ways to overcome these limitations in future work. Additionally, while the paper mentioned that some of the predictions marked incorrect were likely examples of omitted medications or billing codes, it would have been helpful to provide more detailed analysis and examples of these cases. This could have enhanced the understanding of the potential errors and omissions in the data and how the model could help address them.

{"id":"74c52980-c0a1-40eb-9c70-1b9a203e350e","text":"In light of the detailed author responses and further updates to the manuscript, I am raising my score to an 8 and reiterating my support for this paper. I think it will be among the strongest non-traditional applied deep learning work at ICLR and will receive a great deal of interest and attention from attendees.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis paper describes modern deep learning approach to the problem of predicting the medications taken by a patient during a period of time based solely upon the sequence of ICD-9 codes assigned to the patient during that same time period. This problem is formulated as a multilabel sequence classification (in contrast to language modeling, which is multiclass classification). They propose to use standard LSTM and GRU architectures with embedding layers to handle the sparse categorical inputs, similar to that described in related work by Choi, et al. In experiments using a cohort of ~610K patient records, they find that RNN models outperform strong baselines including an MLP and a random forest, as well as a common sense baseline. The differences in performance between the recurrent models and the MLP appear to be large enough to be significant, given the size of the test set.\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\n- Very important problem. As the authors point out, two the value propositions of EHRs -- which have been widely adopted throughout the US due to a combination of legislation and billions of dollars in incentives from the federal government -- included more accurate records and fewer medication mistakes. These two benefits have largely failed to materialize. This seems like a major opportunity for data mining and machine learning.\r\n- Paper is well-written with lucid introduction and motivation, thorough discussion of related work, clear description of experiments and metrics, and interesting qualitative analysis of results.\r\n- Empirical results are solid with a strong win for RNNs over convincing baselines. This is in contrast to some recent related papers, including Lipton & Kale et al, ICLR 2016, where the gap between the RNN and MLP was relatively small, and Choi et al, MLHC 2016, which omitted many obvious baselines.\r\n- Discussion is thorough and thoughtful. The authors are right about the kidney code embedding results: this is a very promising result.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The authors make several unintuitive decisions related to data preprocessing and experimental design, foremost among them the choice to use ICD-9 codes as the basis for prediction instead of prescription records. While I understand their rationale for using ICD-9 codes, as they are readily available and more consistent across different healthcare systems, it would have been beneficial to include a discussion on the potential limitations of this choice. For example, ICD-9 codes are primarily used for billing and reimbursement purposes and may not always accurately capture the specific medications prescribed to a patient. Additionally, the authors mention that they ignored any medications not in the therapeutic classes they were targeting. This exclusion may introduce bias and limit the generalizability of their results to other therapeutic classes. It would have been valuable to include an analysis of the impact of this exclusion on the performance of their models.\r\n\r\nThe authors mention that hardware constraints limited the size of their best model, a GRU. It would be helpful to know more about these hardware constraints and how they may have influenced the results. Specifically, did the size limitation have any significant impact on the performance of the model? Were there any indications that a larger model could have achieved even higher prediction accuracy?\r\n\r\nWhile the paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of their models, it would have been interesting to see more in-depth analysis of the errors made by the models. Understanding the types of errors and potential sources of mispredictions could provide valuable insights for further improving the models and addressing the issues with medication tracking in electronic medical records. Additionally, it would have been beneficial to discuss the potential implications and challenges of implementing such models in real-world clinical settings. How would these models integrate with existing electronic medical record systems? What are the potential barriers to adoption and how can they be addressed?\r\n\r\nOverall, this paper presents a compelling application of recurrent neural networks to predict medications from diagnostic codes in electronic medical records. The authors address an important problem and provide solid empirical evidence to support the superiority of their models over baselines. However, there are some limitations and unanswered questions that could be further explored to strengthen the paper. I would recommend considering these suggestions in future revisions.","label":381}

Therefore, it would be misleading to make a blanket statement that all minima are decent based solely on theoretical results. It would be more accurate to say that under certain conditions, deep network loss functions tend to converge to decent minima, but there can still be cases where suboptimal or even bad minima are found.One possible explanation for the discrepancy between theory and practice is the presence of noise and randomness in the optimization process. Stochastic optimization methods introduce randomness through the use of mini-batches, learning rate schedules, and other techniques. This randomness can lead to the exploration of different regions of the loss surface and potentially help escape from suboptimal or bad minima. However, it can also hinder convergence and lead to getting stuck in other regions of the loss surface.The authors' empirical investigation of the geometry of loss functions for state-of-the-art networks with multiple stochastic optimization methods is a valuable contribution to the understanding of how deep network optimization works in practice.

They compare the behavior of different optimization methods, including stochastic gradient descent, Adam, and RMSprop, on various datasets and network architectures. This provides a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of these methods and allows the authors to draw meaningful conclusions.Another strength is the visualization of the experiments on polygons. This visual representation helps the reader to visually grasp the behavior of the optimization methods and see how they navigate the loss surface. The authors use different colors to represent the training trajectories of different optimization methods, and this makes it easy to compare and contrast their performance.However, there are some aspects of the paper that could be improved. First, the paper lacks a clear motivation for why understanding the geometry of loss functions and optimization methods is important.

The use of the REINFORCE method for training the actor and the use of the critic to estimate the reward baseline within the REINFORCE objective provide a solid foundation for learning optimal policies.

The use of pointer network is interesting as it enables generalization to arbitrary input size.. The approach presented in the paper focuses on the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and demonstrates its effectiveness in predicting city permutations for TSP instances with up to 100 nodes. Additionally, the same approach is applied to the KnapSack problem, which is another NP-hard problem, and it achieves optimal solutions for instances with up to 200 items. These results provide valuable insights into how neural networks can be utilized as a versatile tool for tackling combinatorial optimization problems. The experiment has been conducted without relying on extensive engineering or heuristic designing, suggesting that the proposed framework has the potential to be applied to a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems without requiring domain-specific expertise. However, it's worth mentioning that the results reported in the paper are still not at the state-of-the-art level, leaving room for further improvement and investigation.","label":29}
